            Below, you'll find the slideshow for our prototype and thought around how the app wil work. The prototype is
            designed to fit both hearing and deaf people.
            The idea behind the desing and functionality of the app, is that it can be used by adult and children.
            Each slideshow shows the functionality of all the buttons on the app and is therefor divided into four
            slideshows. If the user want to navigate back to the home screen, he/she can click on the back button which
            is on every screen
          </p>
          <h2>
            Short about the app:
          </h2>
